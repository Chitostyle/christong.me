					<h4>The Objective</h4>
					<p>The first major redesign for Tracker after years of iterative improvements, the decision to redesign came as a result of a need to make some major changes to the applicationâ€™s core areas to help it scale with the needs of its users.</p>
					<p>In addition to updating the look & feel, our research led us to these goals:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Help team members of various roles collaborate more often and in a more timely manner to changes in both the project and project stories</li>
						<li>Support larger product teams that may have multiple teams and / or multiple tracks fo work</li>
						<li>Provide a higher level view of work being done and progress towards these higher level initiatives</li>
						<li>Faster interface</li>
						<li>Make it easier for specialists such as testers and designers to see their work across multiple projects</li>
						<li>Make it easier to plan releases across multiple teams</li>							
					</ul>

					<h4>The Process</h4>
					<p>We had a few assumptions as to what problems needed to be solved thanks to different feedback mechanisms including Zendesk, GetSatisfaction, Twitter, meetups and in-app metrics.</p>
					<p>To test these assumptions, we conducted interviews with users to help break the problems down further as well as confirm or prove certain assumptions false.</p>
					<p>During data synthesis, we gained a better understanding of many different dimensions including how teams scaled, how user roles impacted what their needs were to collaborate with their team in Tracker, and how teams of different sizes had different needs. To communicate our findings, I created a variety of information models to help communicate the problem space to the team and stakeholders.</p>
					<p>As a result of these findings, the redesign included:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Redesigning information architecture and UI to provide allow the application to elegantly scale with the needs of the teams</li>
						<li>The addition of in-app notifications (previously the only notifications were via email) to improve timeliness of team collaboration and reduce bottlenecks more quickly, resulting in teams delivering more customer value in a shorter period of time</li>
						<li>Adding the a new feature called Epics to allow for higher-granularity planning to supplement story-based planning</li>
						<li>Improved reporting to help product managers understand and improve team health</li>
						<li>A new construct known as workspaces to support cross-project planning</li>
						<li>Simplified design in a joint effort with the developers to create a more responsive interface with focus on stronger visual hierarchy</li>
						<li>Support for different view preferences based on user needs (compact, normal, projector mode, single story view)</li>
					</ul>
