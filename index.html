					<p>For the past 13 years, I've helped clients and teams:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Take a <em>user-centered, data-driven</em> approach to product design &amp; development</li>
						<li>Deliver designs and working product <em>early and often</em></li>
						<li>Validate (and invalidate) product ideas and assumptions quickly to <em>save money</em> and <em>reduce wasted time</em></li>
						<li>Gain fast feedback through product research &amp; testing so more time is spent moving not just in a product direction, but <em>moving in the right direction</em></li>
					</ul>
					<img class="divider" src="images/ball-div.png" />
					<p>I've led both <em>Startups</em> and <em>Enterprise</em> customers grow and scale their teams by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Helping them break down silos and <em>collaborate more closely across teams &amp; roles</em></li>
						<li>Facilitating stronger <em>alignment around outcomes</em> at both the team and stakeholder levels to allow teams to work more autonomously towards these goals &amp; outcomes</li>
